- Add doxygen documentations
- Add synchronous zipping/unzipping option available
- Support zipping/unzipping files and folders even if their total size
  exceeds size of an integer variable or ram of the computer. To support
  that, may we need to flush archive parts from memory to disk gradually
  before waiting compression on all the files to finish.
- Add better error reporting support -- we may use miniz error states
- Improve progress reporting, i.e we should be able to report progress
  for a big chunk of a file, progress reporting should be interrupted
  less frequently
