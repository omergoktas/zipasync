- Add doxygen documentations
- Add support for setting initial cache size
- Add better error reporting support -- we may use miniz error states
- Improve progress reporting, i.e we should be able to report progress
  for a big chunk of a file, progress reporting should be interrupted
  less frequently
- Split up compression task into multiple parts and assign each
  individual part into a processor core. Provide better multi-core
  asynchronous compression support.
