- Add doxygen documentations.
- Add support for setting initial cache size.
- Add better error reporting support -- we may use miniz error states.
- Improve progress reporting, i.e we should be able to report progress
  for a big chunk of a file, progress reporting should be interrupted
  less frequently.
- Split up compression task into multiple parts and assign each
  individual part into a processor core. Provide better multi-core
  asynchronous compression support.
- Add support for Qt Resource file and folders on zip and zipSync
  functions.
- Add support for other useful compression and extraction operations
  (e.g. plain old data compression and extraction, or other useful
  features miniz itself alone offers)
